# 697. Degree of an Array
# Easy

# Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.

# Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.

class Solution:
    def findShortestSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right, count = {}, {}, {}
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            if x not in left: left[x] = i
            right[x] = i
            count[x] = count.get(x, 0) + 1

        ans = len(nums)
        degree = max(count.values())
        for x in count:
            if count[x] == degree:
                ans = min(ans, right[x] - left[x] + 1)

        return ans
